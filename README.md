### Bonjour! 
My name is [St√©phane Marguerin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/st%C3%A9phane-marguerin-5971a040/) and I am a french senior R&D development manager working at the [Lyon office](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Ansys+France+SAS/@45.7754335,4.8597945,19.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47f4c01f22db66e5:0xd13dd6c5dfa85d7d!8m2!3d45.7757573!4d4.8601922) of [Ansys Inc.](https://www.ansys.com) for cloud and platform oriented projects. My first source of pride at work is to manage talented and passionate software engineers!

And when I need fresh air, I am driving family and/or friends to the [beach on this lovely french island](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/%C3%8Ele+d'Ol%C3%A9ron/@45.9949208,-1.3862059,6650m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x480160677dfb104b:0xf05d3935f88ea80!8m2!3d45.953973!4d-1.2733651) (reach out to get a few good spots there).
